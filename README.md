Frontiers in science is the core natural sciences module, worth 30 credits.

The second year comprises several smaller experiments and then a larger group project. 
1. details the tracking of organisms using colour thresholding and a raspberry pi camera, assesed via report(68/100)
2. contains of a object oriented fractal growth simulation which was then compared to practical experiments, assesed via poster(66/100)
3. the larger group project was an examination of Physarum polycephalum electrotaxis. Which used thresholding and problem solving. Assesed via report(69/100) and presentation(88/100).
