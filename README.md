Here is my report written as part of the PHY2047 module on climate change, the brief was to write a max 3000 word report that focused around any area of science. I was drawn to this area owing to my interests in large simulations and getting accurate predictions of future warming. I scored a mark of 88/100 and it comprised 60% of the module.
